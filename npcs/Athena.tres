I need your help. 

I was looting the castle and I almost got caught. I had to stash my stuff in a secret chamber near the library.

I can't show my face in there again. Can you get it for me.

 You can use the \"go\" command to move around within a world.

Also, don't forget to use the 'help' command.

Thanks!"
